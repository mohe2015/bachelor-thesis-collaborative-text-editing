  abstract  = {Group editing is a crucial feature for many end-user applications. It requires high responsiveness, which can be provided only by optimistic replication algorithms, which come in two classes: classical Operational Transformation (OT), or more recent Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs).Typically, CRDTs perform better on downstream operations, i.e., when merging concurrent operations than OT, because the former have logarithmic complexity and the latter quadratic. However, CRDTs are often less responsive, because their upstream complexity is linear. To improve this, this paper proposes to interpose an auxiliary data structure, called the identifier data structure in front of the base CRDT. The identifier structure ensures logarithmic complexity and does not require replication or synchronization. Combined with a block-wise storage approach, this approach improves upstream execution time by several orders of magnitude, with negligeable impact on memory occupation, network bandwidth, and downstream execution performance.},

  abstract  = {Undo and redo functionality is ubiquitous in collaboration software. In single user settings, undo and redo are well understood. However, when multiple users edit a document, concurrency may arise, leading to a non-linear operation history. This renders undo and redo more complex both in terms of their semantics and implementation.We survey the undo and redo semantics of current mainstream collaboration software and derive principles for undo and redo behavior in a collaborative setting. We then apply these principles to a simple CRDT, the Multi-Valued Replicated Register, and present a novel undo and redo algorithm that implements the undo and redo semantics that we believe are most consistent with users' expectations.},
